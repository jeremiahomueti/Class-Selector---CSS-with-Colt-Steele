The next selector we're going to look at is the class selector. 

CLASS SELECTOR

Select elements with class called 'complete'

.complete {
    color: green;
}

Classes are similar to IDs, where we add something to our markup
so that we can hook into it from CSS. Except that you can add
a class to different elements, so a class of elements.
